This project consists of code adapted from [this Github Project](http://hplgit.github.io/web4sciapps/doc/pub/web4sa_django.html), which was originally written in October, 2015 for earlier versions of both Django and Python. Updates have been made so that the project works in the versions of Django/Python seen above.

Code was updated by a **complete amateur**, so take everything here with a grain of salt.
